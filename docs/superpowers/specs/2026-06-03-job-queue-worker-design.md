# Job Queue & Worker Tier — Design

**Issue:** #9 (M0) · **Depends on:** #7 (repository layer, locks, idempotency —
merged) · **Decisions:** [ADR-0018](../../adr/0018-job-queue-worker-execution.md),
refining [ADR-0008](../../adr/0008-async-worker-tier-job-queue.md) ·
**Parent spec:** [`docs/specs/m0-walking-skeleton.md`](../../specs/m0-walking-skeleton.md)
("Job queue & worker tier", "Failure & retry")

## Goal

The durable-job execution layer for the M0 walking skeleton: a Postgres-backed
queue with at-least-once delivery, lease/heartbeat, bounded retries, and admission
idempotency, plus a worker that claims jobs and dispatches them to handlers
registered per kind. Three new modules under `src/kdive/jobs/`:

- `models.py` — the `JobHandler` callable type and a `HandlerRegistry` keyed by
  `JobKind`.
- `queue.py` — connection-scoped `enqueue` / `dequeue` / `heartbeat` / `complete` /
  `fail` operating on the existing `jobs` table.
- `worker.py` — a `Worker` that owns a pool and runs the claim → heartbeat →
  dispatch → finalize loop.

This layer sits above the repository/idempotency layer (#7) and below the MCP
`jobs.*` tools (#10) and the plane handlers (#11+) that register `JobHandler`s. It
owns *how a job is admitted, claimed, kept alive, and finalized*; it does not own
*what a job does* (the handler) or *when a tool enqueues one* (the handler issues).

## Non-goals

- **No MCP wiring.** `jobs.get/.wait/.cancel/.list` are #10's tools; `jobs.cancel`'s
  state write (`queued|running → canceled`) is reachable today via
  `JOBS.update_state`, and the worker's `worker_id`/`state='running'` fencing already
  makes a concurrently-canceled job a no-op for `complete`/`fail` (cooperative
  cancellation). No `cancel` primitive ships here.
- **No reconciler sweep.** Dead-lettering a job *abandoned after exhausting attempts*
  (`running`, lapsed lease, `attempt >= max_attempts`) belongs to the reconciler
  (#12). This layer only guarantees such a job is never re-dequeued.
- **No provider handlers.** M0's `provision`/`build`/`install`/`boot`/`capture_vmcore`
  handlers land with their plane issues; this layer ships the registry they fill and
  is tested against fakes.
- **No per-pool / per-tenant scheduling.** One pool, one tenant at M0;
  `ORDER BY created_at` FIFO satisfies the ADR-0008 fairness rule trivially. A
  `kinds` filter and fair scheduler arrive with M1's second pool.
- **No retry backoff.** A requeued job returns to `queued` and is eligible for the
  very next `dequeue` with no delay — `poll_interval` gates only the empty-queue
  case. So `max_attempts` failures fire back-to-back in milliseconds. This adds no
  resilience to a *transient* dependency outage (still down 3 ms later), but it is
  acceptable for M0's failure set, which is dominated by deterministic failures
  (`configuration_error`, `build_failure`, `missing_dependency`); bounded retry
  still covers the occasional `infrastructure_failure`. A `not_before`/`available_at`
  backoff gate is a schema change deferred to a later milestone.
- **No in-flight cancellation on lease loss.** If a handler's lease lapses mid-run
  (heartbeat fails repeatedly, i.e. the DB is unreachable past the lease), the worker
  does **not** cancel the running handler; its `complete`/`fail` simply fence out and
  another worker may reclaim and re-run the job. Safety then rests on two existing
  layers, not on the worker: the handler's `run_step` ledger (#7) makes a *sequential*
  re-run skip already-committed steps, and the handler's own
  `advisory_xact_lock(SYSTEM, …)` (#7/ADR-0016) serializes a *concurrent* reclaiming
  handler so two provider ops cannot overlap. The worker provides neither guarantee
  and does not need to at M0.
- **No schema change.** The `jobs` table (`dedup_key NOT NULL UNIQUE`, `attempt`,
  `max_attempts`, `worker_id`, `lease_expires_at`, `heartbeat_at`, `result_ref`,
  `error_category`) and the `JobState` `running → queued` requeue edge already exist
  (#6, #5, merged).

## Components

### `models.py` — handler type + registry

```python
type JobHandler = Callable[[AsyncConnection, Job], Awaitable[str | None]]
# returns a result_ref (object-store key) or None; raises to fail the job.

class DuplicateHandler(RuntimeError): ...

class HandlerRegistry:
    def register(self, kind: JobKind, handler: JobHandler) -> None: ...  # raises DuplicateHandler on a second register for a kind
    def get(self, kind: JobKind) -> JobHandler | None: ...
```

A handler receives an injected `AsyncConnection` (so it runs its effects and its
`run_step` ledger writes in the worker-provided transaction) and the claimed `Job`
(its `payload` and `authorizing` tuple). It returns the `result_ref` to store on
success, or raises — a `CategorizedError` to choose the failure category, any other
exception to map to `INFRASTRUCTURE_FAILURE`. `register` rejects a duplicate kind so
two issues cannot silently both claim `provision`.

### `queue.py` — connection-scoped queue operations

All functions take an injected `AsyncConnection` and are transaction-agnostic (they
compose under a caller's `conn.transaction()` and are unit-tested directly). Rows are
read with `dict_row` and validated through `Job.model_validate`, matching
`repositories.py`. `payload`/`authorizing` are wrapped in `Jsonb`.

```python
DEFAULT_MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3
DEFAULT_LEASE = timedelta(minutes=5)

async def enqueue(
    conn, kind, payload, authorizing, dedup_key, *, max_attempts=DEFAULT_MAX_ATTEMPTS
) -> Job: ...

async def dequeue(conn, worker_id, *, lease=DEFAULT_LEASE) -> Job | None: ...

async def heartbeat(conn, job_id, worker_id, *, lease=DEFAULT_LEASE) -> bool: ...

async def complete(conn, job_id, worker_id, result_ref) -> Job | None: ...

async def fail(conn, job, error_category, *, terminal=False) -> Job: ...
```

**`enqueue` — admission idempotency (upsert-then-fetch).** In one transaction:

```sql
INSERT INTO jobs (kind, payload, state, max_attempts, authorizing, dedup_key)
VALUES (%s, %s, 'queued', %s, %s, %s)
ON CONFLICT (dedup_key) DO NOTHING;
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE dedup_key = %s;
```

`enqueue` rejects `max_attempts < 1` with `ValueError` (a boundary guard): a job
with `max_attempts = 0` can never satisfy `dequeue`'s `attempt < max_attempts`
predicate, so it would sit `queued` forever — a silent stuck job. The `SELECT`
returns the pre-existing row on conflict and the freshly inserted row otherwise, so a
re-issued tool gets the **same** `job_id` and never enqueues a duplicate (in whatever
state that job has since reached — `enqueue` never resurrects a finished job; recovery
from a failed run-scoped job is a *new* run with a fresh `dedup_key`, per the parent
spec's "Failure & retry"). `DO NOTHING RETURNING` is deliberately avoided (it returns no row on
conflict). `enqueue` wraps the two statements in its own `conn.transaction()` only
when the connection is not already in one, so it is atomic standalone yet composes
beneath a caller's transaction. (The `INSERT`+`SELECT` must be one transaction so a
concurrent committer's row is visible to the `SELECT` under READ COMMITTED.)

**`dequeue` — claim with reclaim, bounded.** One statement claims the oldest eligible
job and charges an attempt:

```sql
UPDATE jobs SET
    state = 'running', worker_id = %s, attempt = attempt + 1,
    lease_expires_at = now() + %s, heartbeat_at = now()
WHERE id = (
    SELECT id FROM jobs
    WHERE (state = 'queued'
           OR (state = 'running' AND lease_expires_at < now()))
      AND attempt < max_attempts
    ORDER BY created_at
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    LIMIT 1
)
RETURNING *;
```

Returns the claimed `Job`, or `None` when nothing is eligible. The disjunction
reclaims a lapsed-lease (`running`) job; `attempt < max_attempts` bounds reclaim and
leaves a terminally-abandoned job for the reconciler; `SKIP LOCKED` lets parallel
workers claim disjoint rows without blocking; `attempt = attempt + 1` charges the
claim (ADR-0018 decision 1). `now()` is the database clock throughout, so lease
arithmetic needs no synchronized worker clocks.

**`heartbeat` — fenced lease renewal.**

```sql
UPDATE jobs SET heartbeat_at = now(), lease_expires_at = now() + %s
WHERE id = %s AND worker_id = %s AND state = 'running'
RETURNING id;
```

Returns `True` when a row matched, `False` when the job is no longer this worker's
running job (reclaimed, completed, failed, or canceled). The worker's heartbeat task
stops beating on `False` (the job is gone); it does **not** cancel the running
handler (see "No in-flight cancellation" in Non-goals).

**`complete` — fenced success.**
`UPDATE … SET state = 'succeeded', result_ref = %s WHERE id = %s AND worker_id = %s
AND state = 'running' RETURNING *`. Returns the updated `Job`, or `None` if the
fence did not match (the worker lost the job; it logs and drops the result).

**`fail` — requeue-or-dead-letter, fenced.** `terminal` forces dead-letter for a
**non-retryable** failure; otherwise the branch is the claimed job's
already-incremented `attempt`:

```
if terminal or job.attempt >= job.max_attempts:
    UPDATE … SET state = 'failed', error_category = %s
        WHERE id AND worker_id AND state = 'running' RETURNING *   # dead-letter
else:
    UPDATE … SET state = 'queued', worker_id = NULL,
        lease_expires_at = NULL, heartbeat_at = NULL
        WHERE id AND worker_id AND state = 'running' RETURNING *   # requeue
```

Both writes use the `running → {failed,queued}` edges already legal in `JobState`.
The fence makes a `fail` against a reclaimed job a no-op (`RETURNING` yields no row);
`fail` returns the job's post-write state, or the unchanged input job when the fence
missed. `error_category` is ignored on the requeue branch (the job will retry).
`terminal=True` is for a deterministic failure that a retry cannot fix — at M0, the
**no-handler-for-kind** dispatch failure (decision below). Handler exceptions are
*retryable* (`terminal=False`): even a `CategorizedError` may be transient, and M0
does not give handlers a terminal signal (that is a later, additive change). Without
`terminal`, a no-handler job — claimed with `attempt = 1 < max_attempts` — would
*requeue* and spin until it exhausted its attempts instead of failing at once.

### `worker.py` — the claim/dispatch loop

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(
        self, pool, registry, *, worker_id,
        lease=DEFAULT_LEASE,
        heartbeat_interval=timedelta(seconds=30),
        poll_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
    ) -> None: ...  # raises ValueError unless heartbeat_interval <= lease / 3 and pool.max_size >= 2

    async def run_once(self) -> Job | None: ...      # claim+dispatch one job; None if queue empty
    async def run(self, stop: asyncio.Event) -> None: ...  # loop run_once; sleep poll_interval when idle; exit on stop
```

`__init__` rejects `heartbeat_interval > lease / 3`: the `/ 3` margin lets two
heartbeats be missed (a transient DB blip) before the lease lapses, so a sane
configuration cannot silently cause mid-job reclaim and double-run. It also rejects
`pool.max_size < 2`: a dispatched job holds its handler's dispatch connection and the
background heartbeat's connection at the same time, so a single-connection pool would
stall every dispatch until the heartbeat acquisition timed out — a fast, clear
construction error beats that runtime stall. `lease`, `heartbeat_interval`, and
`poll_interval` are otherwise injectable so tests can drive the loop with sub-second
values.

**Transaction granularity.** The worker holds **no** transaction spanning the
handler — a handler runs 30+ minutes (provision/build, ADR-0008), and a transaction
open that long would pin Postgres's xmin horizon and block vacuum. Instead the
handler owns its own short transaction boundaries: each `run_step` (#7) commits in
its own transaction, so partial progress is durable and a retry skips already-done
steps. `dequeue`, `complete`, and `fail` are each their own short transaction. The
handler's object-store writes happen out-of-band (the object precedes its `artifacts`
row, ADR-0013); a write whose job never reaches `complete` is an orphan the
reconciler GCs.

`run_once`:

1. Acquire a pooled connection, `job = await dequeue(conn, worker_id, lease=…)` (its
   own transaction), release. Return `None` if no job.
2. `handler = registry.get(job.kind)`. If `None`: dead-letter at once — `await
   fail(conn, job, NOT_IMPLEMENTED, terminal=True)` on a fresh pooled connection — and
   return the job. (`terminal` because no retry can conjure a handler.)
3. Start a background heartbeat task that, inside `async with pool.connection()`
   (so cancellation releases the connection), loops `await heartbeat(...)` every
   `heartbeat_interval`, stopping when `heartbeat` returns `False` or it is cancelled.
4. Acquire a **dispatch** connection; `result_ref = await handler(conn, job)` (the
   handler commits its own steps as it goes); then `await complete(conn2, job.id,
   worker_id, result_ref)` on a **fresh** pooled connection. If `complete` fences out
   (the job was reclaimed), the handler's already-committed steps and any object
   writes still stand — they benefit the reclaiming worker via `run_step` — and the
   worker logs and drops the result.
5. On a handler exception: map to `error_category` (decision 5) and `await fail(conn3,
   job, category)` on a **fresh** pooled connection — the dispatch connection may be
   left `INERROR` by the handler's aborted transaction, so it is released, not reused —
   then log the category + ids (never the exception text).
6. Cancel and await the heartbeat task in a `finally`; return the job.

`complete` and `fail` run on their own pooled connections (not the dispatch
connection) precisely so a handler that poisoned its connection cannot block the
worker from finalizing the job.

`run` is `while not stop.is_set(): job = await run_once(); if job is None: await
asyncio.sleep(poll_interval)`. The split keeps the loop body (`run_once`) testable
with no sleeping and no event plumbing.

`worker_id` is supplied by the caller (`__main__.py`'s `worker` subcommand, #10);
the spec's worker authorization (service-scoped internal grant, no fresh per-job
auth) is satisfied because the worker performs no authorization — it runs whatever
the authorizing tuple on the job already admitted.

## Concurrency & correctness

- **Bounded retries under worker death** — attempt charged at claim, claim predicate
  `attempt < max_attempts`. A worker that dies mid-run leaves the job `running` with
  a lapsing lease and a spent attempt; reclaim resumes only while attempts remain.
- **Exactly-one finalizer via fencing** — every post-claim write requires
  `worker_id = <me> AND state = 'running'`. Once a lapsed-lease job is reclaimed by
  another worker (new `worker_id`), the original worker's `heartbeat`/`complete`/
  `fail` match zero rows. No double-finalize, no zombie completion.
- **Effect-idempotency beneath admission-idempotency** — `enqueue`'s `dedup_key`
  stops a *duplicate job*; the handler's own `run_step` (#7), committing each step in
  its own short transaction, stops a *duplicate effect* when the same job is retried
  *sequentially*; the handler's `advisory_xact_lock(SYSTEM, …)` (#7) stops a
  *concurrent* double-run when a lapsed lease lets a reclaiming worker overlap the
  original. The worker tier supplies neither — it is responsible only for admission,
  claim, lease, and finalize. A retried job always re-runs the handler; durability of
  partial progress across the retry is exactly what the per-step commits buy.
- **Isolation level** — `enqueue`'s `INSERT`-then-`SELECT` and `dequeue`'s reclaim
  read committed state, so they assume READ COMMITTED (psycopg's default), consistent
  with `idempotency.run_step`.

## Error handling summary

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Re-`enqueue` with an existing `dedup_key` | returns the existing `Job` (no duplicate) |
| Handler raises `CategorizedError` | `fail` with `error.category`; requeue if attempts remain, else dead-letter |
| Handler raises any other exception | `fail` with `INFRASTRUCTURE_FAILURE` |
| No handler registered for `job.kind` | `fail` with `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `terminal=True` — dead-letters at once (no retry) |
| Handler succeeds but job was reclaimed | `complete` fence misses → `None`; the handler's committed steps stand and aid the reclaiming worker via `run_step`; this worker logs and drops |
| `heartbeat` on a reclaimed/finished job | returns `False` (handler may abort) |
| Job abandoned, `attempt < max_attempts` | next `dequeue` reclaims it |
| Job abandoned, `attempt >= max_attempts` | left for the reconciler (#12); never re-dequeued |

## Testing strategy

Disposable Postgres via the existing `tests/db/conftest.py` fixtures, reused from a
new `tests/jobs/conftest.py` (import the `migrated_url` / `postgres_url` fixtures);
async code driven with `asyncio.run(...)` (the established pattern — no
`pytest-asyncio`). Handlers are tested as plain callables with injected fakes
(CLAUDE.md: handlers are the unit of testing). The `Worker` is constructed over a
**real** `AsyncConnectionPool` (`min_size >= 2`, opened on `migrated_url`) so the
dispatch and heartbeat connections are genuinely distinct — a single-connection pool
would serialize them and hide the concurrency the heartbeat depends on. Env-gated
libvirt/gdb/drgn integration tests are untouched and stay gated.

- **`queue.enqueue`** — first call inserts and returns a `queued` job; a second call
  with the **same** `dedup_key` returns the **same** `job_id` with no second row
  (assert one row in `jobs`); a different `dedup_key` makes a distinct job; `payload`
  and `authorizing` round-trip through `jsonb`; `max_attempts < 1` raises `ValueError`.
- **`queue.dequeue`** — claims the oldest `queued` job, setting `running`,
  `worker_id`, `attempt = 1`, a future `lease_expires_at`; returns `None` on an empty
  queue; two concurrent dequeues on two connections claim **different** jobs (SKIP
  LOCKED, no error, no double-claim); a `running` job with a **future** lease is not
  claimed; a `running` job with a **past** lease (simulated lapsed lease) **is**
  reclaimed and its attempt increments; a job at `attempt == max_attempts` is **not**
  claimed.
- **`queue.heartbeat`** — extends `lease_expires_at`/`heartbeat_at` for the owning
  worker (`True`); a wrong `worker_id` or a non-`running` job returns `False` and
  changes nothing.
- **`queue.complete` / `queue.fail`** — `complete` moves `running → succeeded` and
  stores `result_ref` for the owner, `None` for a non-owner; `fail` with
  `attempt < max_attempts` requeues (`running → queued`, `worker_id` cleared), with
  `attempt >= max_attempts` dead-letters (`running → failed`, `error_category` set),
  and with `terminal=True` dead-letters even when `attempt < max_attempts`
  (the no-retry path); a `fail`/`complete` whose fence misses returns the unchanged
  job / `None`.
- **`HandlerRegistry`** — `get` returns a registered handler and `None` for an
  unregistered kind; a second `register` for a kind raises `DuplicateHandler`.
- **`Worker.__init__`** — rejects `heartbeat_interval > lease / 3` with `ValueError`;
  accepts the boundary (`heartbeat_interval == lease / 3`).
- **Heartbeat keeps a live lease** — construct a worker with a short `lease`
  (e.g. 1 s) and shorter `heartbeat_interval` (e.g. 0.25 s); a handler that sleeps
  past the original lease (e.g. 2 s) completes `succeeded`, the job's
  `lease_expires_at` is observed to advance during the run (the heartbeat renewed
  it), and a concurrent `dequeue` by a second `worker_id` does **not** reclaim it
  mid-run. This is the one test that fails if the heartbeat task is never started or
  its SQL is wrong.
- **`Worker.run_once` (the headline acceptance)** — over the real pool on
  `migrated_url`:
  - *happy path*: enqueue → `run_once` dispatches the handler, stores its
    `result_ref`, job ends `succeeded`; a second `run_once` returns `None`.
  - *dedup*: two `enqueue`s with one `dedup_key` then one `run_once` runs the handler
    **once** (assert call count == 1) and the second handle equals the first.
  - *dead-letter*: a handler that always raises, driven by repeated `run_once`,
    reaches `failed` after exactly `max_attempts` dispatches with the mapped
    `error_category`; the handler ran `max_attempts` times.
  - *lapsed lease*: claim a job, force its `lease_expires_at` into the past, and show
    the **next** `run_once` reclaims and runs it (attempt incremented), proving a
    lapsed lease returns the job to the queue.
  - *unknown kind*: a job whose kind has no handler ends `failed` with
    `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` without invoking any handler.
